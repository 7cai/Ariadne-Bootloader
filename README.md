TFTP-Bootloader
===================

Bootloader for Arduino with Ethernet
------------------------------------

This is a work-in-progress bootloader for Arduino Ethernet board and the regular
Arduino with Ethernet Shield.

It is based on previous unfinished work by the Arduino developers as the
developer that was hired to write it never finished it.

The bootloader implements a tftp server on the Arduino board and flashing works
using any regular tftp client.
