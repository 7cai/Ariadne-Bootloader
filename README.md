Ethernet Bootloader
==================

Arduino Ethernet board and TFTP Bootloader
==========================================

This is an unfinished TFTP bootloader for the Arduino Ethernet. The developer that was hired to write it never finished it so we are opening it up to the community in the hope that somebody will fix it and make it work.

It was originally designed to run on both the Arduino Ethernet board and a regular Arduino with Ethernet Shield.

If you intend to work on it, join the Arduino Developers mailing list and let us know.
